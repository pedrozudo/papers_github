	% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
	% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2024
	% package.

	% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
	% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
	% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
	% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

	% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
	% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
	% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% The command takes one argument, which is text to display at the start of the footnote.
